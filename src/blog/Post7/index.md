# Introduction
Cyber crimes are increasingly becoming social engineering, where cyber criminals invest resources and time to gain knowledge about technical and scientific aspects of cyber security and because of that the term “cybercrime” is often confused with the term “cyber security”. Even though the two are extremely different and belong to different areas of expertise, yet they are interrelated with each other. The two are discussed below.

# Relation between Cyber Crime and Cyber Security
Cyber Crime
Cyber crime is a crime that involves the use of computer devices and the Internet. It can be committed against an individual, a group of people, government and private organizations. Usually it is intended to harm someone’s reputation, cause physical or mental harm or to benefit from it, for example, monetary benefits, spreading hate and terror etc. As happened in 1998, a group of Tamil guerrillas, known as Tamil Tigers, sent over 800 e-mails to Sri Lankan embassies. The mails read “We are the Internet Black Tigers and we’re doing this to disrupt your communications.” Intelligence authorities identified it as the first known attack by terrorists against a country’s computer systems.

The main principle of cyber crime law is punishing unauthorized access or illegal use of computer systems and the internet with criminal intentions, so that damage and alteration of systems and data on it can be prevented. However, the largest threat of cybercrime is on the financial security of an individual as well as the government.

# Cyber Security
Cyber security is a technique to protect computers, networks, programs, personal data, etc., from unauthorized access and threats. It is an activity by which information and other communication systems are protected and defended against the unauthorized use or modification or exploitation of the device. Cyber security is also called information technology security. It includes the techniques of protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unauthorized access or attacks that can cause damage to them or exploit them in any way. Basically cyber security is a technical approach to secure systems from such attacks. 

Good cyber security recognizes all the vulnerabilities and threats a computer system or network contains. It then identifies the cause of such vulnerabilities and fixes those vulnerabilities and threats and secures the system. Strong cyber security programs are based on a combination of technological and human elements.

# Differences between Cyber Security and Cyber Crime
There are certain aspects on which cyber crime and cyber security can be differentiated upon, they are:

Types of crimes: In cyber security, the kinds of crimes are where a computer software or hardware or computer network, is the main target (ransomware, viruses, worms, distributed denial of service attacks etc). 
In Cyber crimes, the crimes are where an individual or a group of individuals and their data is the main target. Governments and organizations can also be the targets of cyber crimes (cyber bullying, hate speech, child pornography trafficking, trolling).

Victims: Victims in these two fields are also different. In cyber security, victims are governments and corporations whereas, in cyber crimes, the range of victims is rather broad as victims can extend from individuals, families, organizations, governments and corporations.
Area of Study: Both these fields are studied in different areas. Cyber security is dealt with under Computer science, computer engineering, and information technology. Coding, networking and engineering strategies are used for making networks more secure. 
On the other hand, cyber crimes are dealt with under Criminology, psychology, sociology. Basically, it is the theoretical understanding of how and why crime is committed and how it can be prevented.

# Various elements of cyber security
For a strong cyber security system certain elements are needed. The elements are as following:

Application security: Applications play an essential role in business ventures; that is why every firm needs to focus on web application security. Web application security is important in order to protect customers, their information and interests. Application security helps in thwarting any attempts to violate the authorization limits set by the security policies of the computer system or networks. 
Information security: Information includes business records, personal data, customer’s data, intellectual property etc; hence, it is important for a corporation to have strong cyber security for information to prevent its leakage.
Information security involves safeguarding sensitive information from illegitimate access, usage, or any other kind of damage. This also ensures that the important data does not get lost when any issue like natural disasters, malfunction of system, theft or other potentially damaging situation arises. The characteristics defining information security are confidentiality, integrity and availability. Information security also includes Data Confidentiality, Data integrity, Data availability, and Data authenticity. 

Network Security: Network security consists of protecting the usability and reliability of network and data. A network penetration test is conducted to assess the vulnerabilities in a system and network.

It refers to broad range security policies for thwarting and monitoring unauthorized access, misuse, damage to a computer system and other network systems. Network security extends coverage to diverse computer networks, surrounding private and public communication systems among corporations and organizations.

Disaster Recovery/ Business continuity planning: Business continuity planning (BCP), also known as disaster recovery, is about being prepared for any kind of interference or cyber threat by identifying threats to the systems on time and analyzing how it may affect the operations and methods to counter that threat.
Operational security (OPSEC): Operations security is used to protect organization functions. It identifies important information and assets to track down threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the functional method.
End-user education: It is important for an organization to train their employees about cyber security because human error is one of the major causes of data breaches. Every employee should be aware of the common cyber threats and should have the knowledge to deal with them. 
Training will allow management to accustom themselves with system users and threats to it and user training will help in eliminating resistance to change and advancements and lead to user scrutiny on a closer level.

Leadership commitment: It is important to have leadership commitment in organization and corporations in order to have a strong cyber security program. Without having the leadership in the team it is complicated to develop, implement and maintain the cyber security processes.

# Different Categories of Cyber Crimes
The cyber crimes may be broadly classified into four groups. They are:

# Crime against the Individuals
Crimes against the individual refers to those criminal offences which are committed against the will of an individual to cause certain harm to them like physical or mental harm. For example assault, harassment, kidnapping, and stalking etc. but in cyber crimes the nature of crimes against individual changes a little bit and takes the form of cyber stalking, pornography, cyber bulling, child abuse, fraud, cyber threats etc. Such as cyber defamation is committed to cause harm to the reputation of an individual in the eyes of other individuals through the cyberspace. A few cyber crimes against individuals are: 

Harassment via electronic mails.
Dissemination of obscene material.
Cyber-stalking.
Defamation.
Indecent exposure.
Cheating.
Unauthorized control/access over computer system.
Email spoofing.
Fraud.

# Crime against Property
The second category of cyber crime is that of cyber crimes against property. With the growth of international trade, businesses and consumers are increasingly using computer and the internet to create, transmit and store information in the electronic from instead of traditional form. This has ultimately lead to certain cyber offences which affect a person’s property. These types of cyber crimes include cyber vandalism to steal information of other organizations or to steal someone’s bank details, use software to gain access to an organization’s website etc. This is similar to instances of a criminal illegally possessing an individual’s bank or credit card details. In cyber crime, the hacker steals a person’s bank details to gain access to funds, make purchases online or run phishing scams to get people to give away their information. They could also use any kind of malicious software to gain access to a web page with confidential information. These types of crimes include vandalism of computers, intellectual property crimes (Copyright, patented, trademark etc), online threatening etc. Cyber crimes against property include: 

Computer vandalism.
Transmitting virus.
Net-trespass.
Unauthorized access / control over computer system.
Internet thefts.
Intellectual Property crimes:
Software piracy.
Copyright infringement.
Trademark infringement.
Crime against Governments or Organizations
There are certain cyber crimes committed to threaten the international governments or organizations. These cyber crimes are mainly committed for the purpose of spreading terror among people of a particular country. The instigators or perpetrators of such crimes can be governments of enemy nations, terrorist groups or belligerents etc. Cyber crimes against Government include cyber attack on the government website, military website or cyber terrorism etc. In these kinds of cyber crime, cyber criminals hack governments or organization’s websites, government firm, and military websites and then circulate propaganda or threats or rumors. These cyber crimes are known as cybercrimes against Governments or Organizations. Following are the few examples of crime against Governments or Organizations:

Unauthorized access / control over computer system.
Cyber terrorism against the government or organization.
Possession of unauthorized information.
Distribution of Pirate software.

# Crime against Society
Those cyber crimes which affect the society at large are known as cyber crimes against society. These unlawful acts are committed with the intention of causing harm or such alterations to the cyberspace which will automatically affect the large number of people of society. The main target of these types of crimes is public at large and societal interests. The cyber crimes against society include the following types of crimes: 

Child pornography.
Indecent exposure of polluting the youth financial crimes.
Sale of illegal articles.
Trafficking.
Forgery.
Online gambling.
Web jacking.

# How Data Breaches Happen
Data breaches can be far more than a temporary terror — they may change the course of your life. Businesses, governments, and individuals alike can experience huge complications from having sensitive information exposed. Whether you are offline or online, hackers can get to you through the internet, Bluetooth, text messages, or the online services that you use.

Without proper attention to detail, a small vulnerability can cause a massive data breach.

Since many people are unaware of how common modern security threats work, they don’t give it enough attention.

# What is a Data Breach?
To define data breach: a data breach exposes confidential, sensitive, or protected information to an unauthorized person. The files in a data breach are viewed and/or shared without permission.

Anyone can be at risk of a data breach — from individuals to high-level enterprises and governments. More importantly, anyone can put others at risk if they are not protected.

In general, data breaches happen due to weaknesses in:

Technology
User behavior
As our computers and mobile devices get more connective features, there are more places for data to slip through. New technologies are being created faster than we can protect them.

Devices in the IoT sector are proof that we are increasingly valuing convenience over security.

Many “smart home” products have gaping flaws, like lack of encryption, and hackers are taking advantage.

Since new digital products, services, and tools are being used with minimal security testing, we’ll continue to see this problem grow.

However, even if the backend technology was set up perfectly, some users will likely still have poor digital habits. All it takes is one person to compromise a website or network.

Without comprehensive security at both the user and enterprise levels, you are almost guaranteed to be at risk.

Protecting yourself and others starts with understanding how a data breach occurs.

# How do Data Breaches happen?
The assumption is that a data breach is caused by an outside hacker, but that's not always true.

Reasons for how data breaches happen might sometimes be traced back to intentional attacks. However, it can just as easily result from a simple oversight by individuals or flaws in a company’s infrastructure.

Here’s how a data breach can occur:

An Accidental Insider. An example would be an employee using a co-worker's computer and reading files without having the proper authorization permissions. The access is unintentional, and no information is shared. However, because it was viewed by an unauthorized person, the data is considered breached.
A Malicious Insider. This person purposely accesses and/or shares data with the intent of causing harm to an individual or company. The malicious insider may have legitimate authorization to use the data, but the intent is to use the information in nefarious ways.
Lost or Stolen Devices. An unencrypted and unlocked laptop or external hard drive — anything that contains sensitive information — goes missing.
Malicious Outside Criminals. These are hackers who use various attack vectors to gather information from a network or an individual.

# Malicious Methods used to Breach Data
Since malicious data breaches result from cyberattacks, you should know what to watch for.

Here are some popular methods used by hackers

Phishing
Brute Force Attacks
Malware
Phishing. These social engineering attacks are designed to fool you into causing a data breach. Phishing attackers pose as people or organizations you trust to easily deceive you. Criminals of this nature try to coax you into handing over access to sensitive data or provide the data itself.

Brute force attacks. In a more brash approach, hackers might enlist software tools to guess your passwords.

Brute force attacks

work through all the possibilities for your password until they guess correctly. These attacks take some time but have become rapid as computer speeds continue to improve. Hackers even hijack other devices like yours via malware infections to speed up the process. If your password is weak, it might only take a few seconds to crack it.
 

Malware. Your device’s operating system, software, hardware, or the network and servers you’re connected to can have security flaws. These gaps in protection are sought out by criminals as the perfect place to shove malware into. Spyware specifically is ideal for stealing private data while being completely undetected. You might not find this infection until it’s too late.

# What is targeted in Data Breaches?
Although a data breach can be the result of an innocent mistake, real damage is possible if the person with unauthorized access steals and sells Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or corporate intellectual data for financial gain or to cause harm.

Malicious criminals tend to follow a basic pattern: targeting an organization for a breach takes planning. They research their victims to learn where the vulnerabilities are, such as missing or failed updates and employee susceptibility to phishing campaigns.

Hackers learn a target's weak points, then develop a campaign to get insiders to mistakenly download malware. Sometimes they go after the network directly.

Once inside, malicious criminals have the freedom to search for the data they want — and lots of time to do it, as the average breach takes more than five months to detect.

Common vulnerabilities targeted by malicious criminals include the following:

Weak credentials. The vast majority of data breaches are caused by stolen or weak credentials. If malicious criminals have your username and password combination, they have an open door into your network. Because most people reuse passwords, cybercriminals can use brute force attacks to gain entrance to email, websites, bank accounts, and other sources of PII or financial information.
Stolen credentials. Breaches caused by
phishing

are a major security issue and if cyber criminals get hold of this Personal information, they can use it to access things like your bank and online accounts.
Compromised assets. Various
malware attacks

are used to negate regular authentication steps that would normally protect a computer.
Payment Card Fraud. Card skimmers attach to gas pumps or ATMs and steal data whenever a card is swiped.
Third-party access. Although you may do everything possible to keep your network and data secure, malicious criminals could use third-party vendors to make their way into your system.
Mobile Devices. When employees are allowed to bring their own devices (BYOD) into the workplace, it's easy for unsecured devices to download malware-laden apps that give hackers to data stored on the device. That often includes work email and files as well as the owner's PII.
The damage a Data Breach can do
In many cases, data breaches cannot just be patched up with some password changes. The effects of a data leak can be a lasting issue for your reputation, finances, and more.

For business organizations: a data breach can have a devastating effect on an organization's reputation and financial bottom line. Organizations such as Equifax, Target, and Yahoo, for example, have been the victims of a data breach. And today, many people associate/remember those companies for the data breach incident itself, rather than their actual business operations.

For government organizations: compromised data can mean exposing highly confidential information to foreign parties. Military operations, political dealings, and details on essential national infrastructure can pose a major threat to a government and its citizens.

For individuals: identity theft is a major threat to data breach victims. Data leaks can reveal everything from social security numbers to banking information. Once a criminal has these details, they can engage in all types of fraud under your name. Theft of your identity can ruin your credit, pin you with legal issues, and it is difficult to fight back against.

While these are common cases, the harm done by data breaches can extend far beyond these situations. So, it is essential that you investigate whether your data has already been exposed. To find out if your personal or work accounts have been compromised use https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to check (this tool checks existing data breaches for your email address and reports what was leaked).

You might want more comprehensive monitoring to know in real-time if your data has leaked. Products like Kaspersky Security Cloud offer data leak detection and help you navigate the situation.

Of course, the best way to protect yourself is to avoid being a victim in the first place. No security plan is perfect, but there are ways you can defend yourself — whether you’re an individual or an enterprise.

# How to prevent being a Data Breach victim
Data breach prevention needs to include everyone at all levels — from end-users to IT personnel, and all people in between.

When you’re trying to plan how to prevent data breach attacks or leaks, security is only as strong as the weakest link. Every person that interacts with a system can be a potential vulnerability. Even small children with a tablet on your home network can be a risk.

Here are a few best practices to avoid a data breach

Patching and updating software as soon as options are available.
High-grade encryption for sensitive data.
Upgrading devices when the software is no longer supported by the manufacturer.
Enforcing BYOD security policies, like requiring all devices to use a business-grade VPN service and antivirus protection.
Enforcing strong credentials and multi-factor authentication to encourage better user cybersecurity practices. Encouraging users to start using a password manager can help.
Educating employees on best security practices and ways to avoid socially engineered attacks.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, cyber security can be considered as a set of guidelines and actions intended and needed to prevent cybercrime but cyber security is not only limited to that. The two types of problems differ considerably in terms of what happens and who the victims are, as well as the academic areas that study them. Therefore, the two, cyber security and cyber crimes, must be considered as separate issues, with different safeguards designed to address the different privacy and security issues of each.

All sorts of data whether it is personal, governmental, or corporate need high security. Some of the data, which belongs to the government defense system, scientific research and developments, banks, defense research and development organization, etc. are highly confidential and even small amount of negligence to these data may cause great damage to the whole nation or society at large, therefore, such data need security at a very high level.

Hence, cyber security is all about protecting government, organizations and corporate networks, intending to make it difficult for hackers to find weaknesses and exploit them or threaten them. Cybercrime, on the other hand, tends to focus more on individuals and families online. It is highly needed that the top leaders of an organization or government should invest in the cyber security measures to make it strong and impenetrable.
